There are more than 100 combinatorial structures whose cardinalities are given by the Catalan numbers. Examples are balanced parenthesis, binary tress and triangulations of an n-gon, and permutations sortable by one pass through a stack.

On the surface, these structures are very different, but being 
equinumerous there must be one-to-one correspondences that allows us 
to translate between them. In this project we study commonalities 
shared by Catalan structures by programming one-to-one 
correspondences. We do this in a systematic way by recursively 
decomposing the structures. The actual one-to-one correspondences are 
then automatically derived, given the decompositions.
